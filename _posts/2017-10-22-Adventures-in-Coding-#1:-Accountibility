Hello!

I will be attempting to write a weekly journal of my coding adventures on freeCodeCamp. I am currently learning JS on their site. 
I have had issues in the past with accountability when learning new languages. I have read several places that journaling or 
blogging about your daily struggles/acomplishments can help with accountiability. I also downloaded an app called 
[Enki](https://www.enki.com/), which is like duoLingo for coding. It has streaks and notifications and teams to keep you 
accountable.

Today I completed a few challenges on freeCodeCamp in Javascript. A thought ran through my head: Once I complete these challenges,
how will I ever remember how to use all of this syntax? I guess if I am diligent with my learning, it will click, and I can be a 
sucessful dev.

I will make another post the next time I complete some challenges, or the next time I remember.
